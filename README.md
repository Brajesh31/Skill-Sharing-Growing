# Skill-Sharing & Learning Platform

## Overview

In response to a growing need for interactive and engaging learning platforms, our team has embarked on a mission to build a **Skill-Sharing and Learning Platform**. This client web application provides users with a dedicated space to share their skills, track learning progress, create structured learning plans, and engage with fellow learners.

By leveraging **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, we ensure seamless interactions, robust security, and system scalability. User authentication is managed using **OAuth 2.0**, allowing secure sign-in via existing social media accounts.
